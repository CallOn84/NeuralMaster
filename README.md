# NeuralMaster
This is the repository for NeuralMaster, which includes training data and more.

# About the project
NeuralMaster is a project that derives of Leela Chess Zero, our beloved neural network. Instead of training Lc0 through unsupervised learning, NeuralMaster is trained using over 90,000 games from strong chess players throughout history. The goal is to elevate the human-like approach that Lc0 is well known for, but hopefully, add more flair to its play. NeuralMaster should be creative as an artist and brutal like a butcher.

# Where are they rated?
Tests are currently under way to determine the strength of the various nets for NeuralMaster. The nets will face against Stockfish 10. All nets will have a time control of 1 minute + 1 second increment, while Stockfish 10 will have a time control of 1 minute + 0.7 seconds increment. All engines will have a 3-4-5 and 6-wdl tablebases. All results will be published on neuralmaster.weebly.com and on here.
